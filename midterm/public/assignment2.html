        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>You will fill in the matching stylesheet for the provided HTML so that the rendered page matches 
            the provided mockup image (differences due to browser window size are expected - your page should 
            work for a wide range of desktop window sizes, but is not expected to work at mobile sizes yet).

        <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>add, commit, and push the branch to github</li>
            <li>Create a PR to merge to main</li>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A trick I didn't mention in class is that you can put a border on just one side: 
                border-bottom: 1px solid black; or border-right: 1px solid black;</li>
            <li>You can view the file using either File->Open File in Chrome or by serving the page 
                by using npx serve in this directory and visiting http://localhost:5000/homepage.html 
                in the browser.</li>
            <li>The links are not going to work if you follow them - that's fine, they are not part of the assignment.</li>
