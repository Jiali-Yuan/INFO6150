        <h1>Assignment - Basic Form</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>You will create an HTML page and matching CSS file that can be served using npx serve in this directory. 
            You should include at least one fake menu on the page to simulate being a page that is part of an entire site. 
            Style that menu as you like, per the best practices from class.
        </p>
        <span>The form should have these visual and functional parts:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Form should submit as POST (we don't have a url to actually submit to, that's fine)</li>
            <li>Collect a user's name (as field "name")</li>
            <li>Collect a user's email (as field "email")</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="submission">
        <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start from the up-to-date main branch (git checkout main; git pull origin main)</li>
            <li>Create a feature branch named 'basic-forms' (git checkout -b basic-forms)</li>
            <li>Add the necessary files in this directory (or a subdirectory) to have the required features</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="requirement">
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not use transitions, animations, or other effects not yet covered in class</li>
            <li>Do not use table, CSS table-cell, floats, or other related concepts for layout</li>
            <li>You are not yet expected to have layouts that work well at mobile dimensions</li>
