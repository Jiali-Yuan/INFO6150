            <p>If you are going to splurge for a dessert, you should choose one that contains real sugar instead of artificial 
                sweeteners.These artificial sweeteners are put in many desserts under the false pretense that they are healthier 
                for you. The chemicals in these additives can lead to health risks down the line. In fact, for 12 days, 
                scientists researched the long term effects of sugar in comparison to aspartame, an artificial sweetener. 
                They found that table sugar -- sucralose, an artificial sweetener -- reduces levels of cortisol, the stress 
                hormone in the bodyðŸ˜‹</ p>
