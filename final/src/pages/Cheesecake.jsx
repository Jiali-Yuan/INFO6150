                    1 cup FAV R PAC Roasted Fiji Apples
                    <br />
                    1 Tbsp Ocean Spray Craisins
                    <br />
                    2 Tbsp Blueberry Almond Crumb Topping (see  recipe)

                <p>
                Beat cheese and add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sugar and vanilla or amaretto 
                and blend well. Fill very small paper baking cups 3/4 full. Bake at 300 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. The cakes 
                will fall slightly when removed from the oven. Cover each cake with 1/2 teaspoon of topping and bake 5 minutes longer. 
                Decorate with a bit of candied fruit or ground toffee.
